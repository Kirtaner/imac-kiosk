    <h1>Diagnostics Process and Fees</h1>

    <p>THERE IS NO DIAGNOSTICS CHARGE WHEN WE COMPLETE YOUR REPAIRS. WE SIMPLY CHARGE YOU FOR THE REPAIRS.<br>
    THERE IS A DIAGNOSTICS CHARGE WHEN YOU DECLINE OUR REPAIR ESTIMATES. WE SIMPLY CHARGE YOU FOR THE DIAGNOSTICS.<br>
    Diagnostics fees are charged when the customer declines to proceed with the repair -- typically when our estimate for the cost of repairs exceeds the economic value of the device.</p>

    <p>You either pay for the repair charges approved by you, or our diagnostics fee. Diagnostics fees are waived if we complete the approved repair.</p>

    <p>Final charges are either:</p>

    <p>For repairs completed<br>
    (diagnostics fees do not apply, repair charges do apply)</p>

    <p>OR</p>

    <p>For diagnosis efforts<br>
    (when no repair is peformed, diagnostics fees apply)</p>

    <p>We will not charge you both Repair Cost and Diagnostics Fee for the same device on the same work order.</p>

    <p>
    Diagnostic Fees:</p>

    <p>Desktop Computers, Laptops, Macbooks:.....................................$40.00<br>
    Gaming Consoles:.............................................................................$40.00<br>
    All other Handheld Devices:............................................................$25.00</p>

    <p>Repair Approval Limit:</p>

    <p>Upon completion of diagnostics, if the repair cost does not exceed $79.95 (before tax) we will proceed with the repairs without providing an estimate or seeking further approval. If our estimate exceeds $79.95, we will call you, and provide our estimate for your approval before proceeding with the repair.</p>

    <p>
    Liquid Damage Fees:</p>

    <p>Liquid Damage Cleaning Fee:</p>

    <p>Phone's &amp; Tablets........................................................$40.00<br>
    Gaming Systems...........................................................$40.00<br>
    Desktop Computers, Laptops, Macbooks.................$60.00</p>

    <p>Liquid damage device cleaning is not classified as a repair and the Liquid Damage Cleaning Fee is not a repair charge. A liquid damage cleaning fee may accompany a dignostics fee should a repair estimate be declined.</p>

    <p>Devices which are restored to functionality as a result of liquid damage cleaning are not classified as being repaired.</p>

    <h2>Liquid Damage Processes and Fees</h2>

All digital devices, phones, laptops, tablets, etc are liquid-phobic. Depending on the extent of the liquid exposure, these devices are often beyond repairing.

Devices commonly go through a washing cycle, get dropped in swimming pools, toilet bowls, bath tubs, or snow, and get quenched with water, milk, juice, coffee, beer, suntan lotions, etc.

The one thing you should not do is turn it on, while the one thing that you should do is to bring/send the device in to us, at The TechKnow Space, ASAP.

Most typically, after a bout with the pernicious liquids, the first human response is to see if the device is alive by powering it up. This damages the device since the battery power heats up the circuits and dissipates and flushes the liquids through the devices. The more frequently the device is powered on, or the longer it stays powered on, the less likely it is to be saved.

What's the big deal about liquid-damaged devices?

Warrantys and Extended Warrantys do not offer coverage or provide protection
Accidental Warrantys typically allow for swapping the liquid-damaged device with a new or refurbished device. Worse, these Accidental Warrantys cost between $200 to $300 per year, plus a deductible of $100 to $300 for the replacement device. frown
In both these situations, you have lost all your data....ouch cry
The TechKnow Space will bring smiles to your wet and weeping devices:

Save 80% of your devices (phones/laptops, tablets, etc)within 2 to 10 hours embarassed
The cost will range typically between $40 and $150
Once the device ia alive, you typically have:
All your data (calendar, emails, contacts, pictures, music, etc) smile
All your applications tongue-out
All your configurations set to your preferences and comfort settings wink
 ANALYSIS PROCESS
Our Easy Liquid Damage Repair Process.  You pay cleaning fee in advance & we start the cleaning process.  Can corrosion be cleaned? If not we do not proceed, device is not econimically repairable. If yes we determine whether a repair is needed.  If no repairs needed, you pick up your working device with no further charges owing.  If repairs are needed we procide an estaimate for your approval.  If you decline the estimate, you pick up your un-repaired device and no further charges are owing. If you approve the estimate we go ahead with the repair, you pick up your repaired device and pay the repair charges.

Initially, all devices typically seem to work with one or two functions impaired or lost. Most customers call us asking us to repair that failed function/s, since the device seems to otherwise work.

We have to then spend time explaining to them that liquid-damaged devices exhibit a behavior that can be described as a “cascading” failure, beginning with a failure of one function, and over time, having other functions start to fail.

We explain how, depending on the extent of liquid exposure, repairs are often futile and a waste of money, unless we can ascertain the extent of the damage and go through a damage diagnostics process as follows:

We thoroughly clean each component in the device to remove all traces of  moisture and humidity. This process takes about an hour of work, completed over one day.
If we are satisfied that the moisture has been completely removed, we then complete a diagnostics to ascertain the functionality and the repairs needed.
We then call you to let you know the problems identified and the cost of repairs. Upon getting  your authorization, we complete the repairs within a few hours.
Despite our judgment that the device can probably be saved, we offer no warranties for repairs done, since liquid-damaged devices are subject to unpredictable failures.
Depending on the extent of liquid damage, and only you know this best, the probability of saving your devices is typically 75+ percent.
If your device has experienced significant liquid-damage (dropped in swimming pool for more than a couple of minutes, experienced a wash cycle, etc), we suggest you abandon and buy a replacement device. If liquid exposure is less severe (typically less than 30 seconds), it would make sense to bring/send it in.
If your device cannot be saved (when moisture has damaged the main board or the brain of your device), we call and advise you as such. We do not suggest replacing main logic boards since this can be exhorbitantly expensive, and we certainly encourage you to replace the device with a new one.
 MANAGING EXPECTATIONS
Managing expectations is a key component of any relationship, which is the goal of this communication. Rather than sending us your favorite device from Vancouver or even driving all the way to our downtown store, we would hope you use this page to ascertain the risks and proceed accordingly.

Customers may or may not be aware of liquid damage to their device(s).

Customers Who Are Aware of Liquid Damage

We charge an upfront non-refundable cleaning fee for all liquid damaged devices as follows:
Handheld Devices:     $40.00
Laptops/Macbooks:   $60.00

Upon completion of cleaning, if we conclude that the moisture has been sufficiently cleaned from your mainboard for your device to have a reasonable chance for survival, we will call you with our estimate for the actual repairs.If approved, we will proceed with the repairs. The total charge to you will be the up-front charge for cleaning plus the cost of repairs approved by you.  If the device is not repairable or not cost effective to repair we will return the device to you with no further charge.

Customers Unaware of Liquid Damage

If we discover during the course of diagnosis or repair that the device has experienced liquid damage, we will stop the diagnostics and call to advise you about the additional cleaning charge. If you approve, we proceed with the cleaning. Upon completion of cleaning, if we conclude that the moisture has been sufficiently cleaned from your mainboard for your device to have a reasonable chance for survival, we will call you with our estimate for the actual repairs. If approved, we will proceed with the repairs. The total charge to you will be the cleaning charge plus the cost of repairs approved by you.  If the moisture has not been adequately removed, we re-assemble the device and call to advise you to pick up (or return ship) your device. The cleaning fee will be due.

We do look forward to helping you save and repair your devices.
