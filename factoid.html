Although Apple’s iPhones generally receive the most hype and publicity, world-wide approximately 88.3% of all mobile phones in use today are not iPhones.  Further, Android is king by far in terms of OS used on smart phones with a whopping 84.7% market share according to Business Insider (August 15, 2014).


The top 5 countries in the world with the most currently active cell phones are: China: 1.2 billion phones; India: 904 million phones; U.S. 327 million phones; Brazil: 276 million phones; and Russia: 256 million phones. That said, the highest number of active phones per person for a country is Montenegro at 192.5% or nearly two phones per person.  The runner up on that list is Hong Kong at 187.9%.


iPhone 5 Black Diamond is the costliest phone in the world, which costs $15 million.  It will take nine weeks to build, made of 135 gram solid gold of 24 carat and the chassis was inlaid with 600 white diamonds.

Nokia is developing a method of harvesting radio-waves, which would recharge your phone while it’s on standby.

The first photo to be publicly-shared using a cell phone was taken on June 11, 1997 by Philippe Kahn
